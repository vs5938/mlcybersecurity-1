This repo contains the content done for ML for cybersecurity. This contains all the code used till now to generate adversarial examples for website fingerprinting.
These are the papers which have been referred when trying to perform this project.

Code repo of random forest code from here. This code was used to generate the model and then used for adversarial examples for this:

Datasets from here:

This is written in python and executed on google colab. You can run this on your local notebook as well. For this, you will need to install packages manily 
numpy, seaborn, matplotlib. Code to fetch the data from google drive is provided as well. This will make it easier for you to run this once you add this script 
to your colab project. 

The main script is fingerprinting_using_RF.ipynb. Rest all code was written at the start of the course for setting up repo. This script contains all the required code
to run my script.
